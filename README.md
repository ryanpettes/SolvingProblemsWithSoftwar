# SolvingProblemsWithSoftware
##Coursework for the first module in Duke's Coursera "OOP in Java" course.

This respository contains code written as part of the first module (Java Programming: Solving Problems with Software) of Duke's *Coursera* course â€“ **Object Oriented Programming in Java**.
Here is a link to the [course's homepage](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/object-oriented-programming).

This specific course used **BlueJ**, and IDE developed specifically for this course by Duke. It also incorporated a **Duke-made** library. The course also familiarized us with working with `.csv` files using Apache's CSVParser().
